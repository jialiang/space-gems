##Space Gems

Space Gem is a relaxing tile-matching game reminiscence of simpler times when games of this genre did not come bundled with micro-transactions and in-app advertisements.

It is made with React, following proper React patterns. However, [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact), a "tiny (3kb) implementation of the core value of React", is used in the end product instead of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [React-DOM](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-dom). The [Preact-Compat](https://github.com/developit/preact-compat) library is also added to serve as a compatibility layer to avoid the need to make changes to the existing code. This was done to reduce the file size of the end product. As a result, the entire source code of the game now weights in at only 27kb gzipped. For comparison, the React-DOM library alone weights in at a hefty 30kb gzipped.

The beautiful backgrounds featured in the game is courtesy of [Reimund Bertrams](https://pixabay.com/en/users/daswortgewand-8385/), who was kind enough to release them under the CC0 license, while the ambient music is produced by [Purple Music](https://www.purple-planet.com/using-our-free-music) and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0.

This project is made locally in Singapore with 100% hand-crafted code.
